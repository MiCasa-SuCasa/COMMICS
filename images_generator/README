This software is intended to be compiled as a shared object (.so)
It is used to generate several images shown in the COMMICS web application.
In order to make it work properly you will need to install:
* cmake 2.4 or upper
* swig
* qt development libraries
* perl development libraries

To compile it, just type ccmake path/to/CMakeLists.txt
Two files will be generated: libcompclusteringengine.so and compclusteringengine.pm
